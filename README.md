# DES_cryptanalysis
Implementation of various techniques for cryptanalysis of different versions of DES

## Brute Force
The implementation of Brute Force in which we create all possible keys and run the code to genrate cipher than compare it with calculated cipher

Performance -> 20 miliseconds to run a exaustive search for a plain cipher text pair
Acuracy -> About 5 to 10 possible keys for a single pair
